\section{Expected Results}

    The research aims to validate the existence of a meaningful relationship between algorithmic complexity of neural network weights and their inference performance~\cite{murta2025complexity}, as well as find the mathematical relation between those measures.

    \subsection{Primary Outcomes}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Quantitative Relationship}: Mathematical characterization of the complexity-performance relationship with statistical significance measures
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Expected Impact}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Practical}: 
            The results may enable new optimization approaches that consider both training error and model complexity, potentially leading to more efficient training methods~\cite{chollet2019measure}.

            \item \textbf{Theoretical}: 
            Better understanding of how complexity relates to generalization in neural networks, contributing to the broader understanding of emergent capabilities in large language models~\cite{wei2022emergent}.
        \end{itemize}
