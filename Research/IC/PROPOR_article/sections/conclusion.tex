\section{Conclusion}

It is safe to safe that the inclusion of sentiment analysis in time series forecasting models has demonstrated a measurable improvement in predictive accuracy, even if modest.

The ARIMA models, in particular, benefited significantly from the integration of sentiment data, suggesting that these models are more adept at leveraging qualitative information to enhance their forecasts. The LSTM models also showed improvement to a lesser extent.

We also observed that models whose sentiment evaluations were closer to human assessments tended to perform better in forecasting tasks. This finding highlights the importance of aligning model biases with human perspectives.
