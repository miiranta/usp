Hey

Most of that folder is in portuguese (i mean, almost all) 
as i'm brazillian and i didn't worry about writting everything in english while i was first learning C.

Believe, you are not loosing anything useful. The Cool Stuff is in the "Cool Stuff Folder" (Dah?), all translated.
New repositories are fully in english too.

Thanks :p
